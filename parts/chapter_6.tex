\chapter{Planning a Scrum Project}

The Scrum planning process sets stakeholders’ expectations. These stakeholders include those who fund the project, those who intend to use the functionality created by the project, and those who will be otherwise affected by the project. The plan is a way of synchronizing stakeholders’ expectations with the Team’s expectations.

At the end of the Sprint, the stakeholders attend the Sprint review meetings and compare the project’s actual progress against its planned progress.

Changes in course and revisions to the plan made in Sprint planning meetings are explained to the stakeholders.
